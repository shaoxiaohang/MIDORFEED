1: can only create vec3 vertex. what if vec2 vertex like full screen quad coordinate.
2: Array should accept a pointer to the data and size of the data, like a float pointer.
3: Need think a better to handle the cached render state, skybox change the render state.
4: skybox used in two different draw pass, two shader, binding point has to be the same, need to fix it.
5: Need a better framework for the program and shader, when you add geometry shader, put too much hack in it.
6: Need a better way to make the depth visualization and sentencil buffer working. The modified render state and program is bull shit.
7:Cull face is not working correctly , need figure out why.
8: MSAA need get it working for offline rendering.
9: FrameBuffer dont work with NSight.
Post Effect Notes:
The last post effect processor should write to the main frame buffer(unbind)
